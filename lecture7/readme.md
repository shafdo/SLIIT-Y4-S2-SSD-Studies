# Authorization

## What is Authorization/Access Control

- Mechanism using with a system grants permission to access/modify some data or perform some action.

## Categorization by Implementation

1. Logical Controls

2. Administrative Controls

3. Physical Controls

## Categorization by time continuum

1. Directive Controls: Designed to establish desired outcomes

2. Deterrent controls: Designed to discourage
an attacker

3. Preventive controls: Designed to prevent an
attack from happening

4. Compensating controls: Designed to
compensate for a risk thatâ€™s too difficult to
address

5. Detective controls: Designed to detect an
attack while it is happening

6. Corrective controls: Designed to mitigate the
damage once an attack/intrusion has taken
place

7. Recovery controls: Designed to bring back a
system to its normal operational state

## Categorization by Enforcement

1. Discretionary Access Controls (DAC): Owner of the data determine privileges

2. Mandatory Access Controls (MAC): Defined by System or as per Organizational Security Policy

3. Non-Discretionary Access Controls: Defined by the Administrator

## Data Access Control Methods

- ACL

- Access Control Matrix: Same thing as ACL in a form of table

- Rule based Access Control: Access Control based on rules

- Role based Access Control: Access Control based on user role

- Content Dependent Access Control: Based on actual content rather than role. Can be used in environments when roles change frequently.

- Constrained User Interface: Limit functions user have access to.

- Capability Tables: Match Subjects with their capabilities

- Temporal (Time-Based) Isolation: Constrain access on Time
